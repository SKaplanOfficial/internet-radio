The afrobeat is characterized by large instrumental ensembles, long rhythmic works, improvisation, which greatly brings the genre closer to jazz, and politicized texts. Its main developer is Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and leader of Nigeria '70 (formerly known as Koola Lobitos) Fela Kuti, who coined the name of the genre as early as 1963 and popularized the genre in the 1970s. In the 21st century, the term afrobeats has emerged, which is often referred to as popular Ghanaian music, hiplife, Afro-pop or popular Nigerian music, in which afrobeat is often mixed with highlife, fuji, juju, hip-hop and RnB.",
